# My Project

This is a sample README file.

## Code Example

Here's an example of how to use the main script:

\```python
# File /src/main.py
import os

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

# EndFile /src/main.py
\```

Note that the above is just an example and not an actual file in the project.
