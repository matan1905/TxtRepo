You'll receive a repository code (with lines) and a Git issue (title and body).

Respond with code changes, use this format:

To Create or Replace ENTIRE FILES:

# File /path/to/file
create or replace FULL files
# EndFile /path/to/file

For multiple files, repeat the format.
Note this will REMOVE all other content that is not part of what you write! so be very careful with it!!! 
if you just need a quick edit, use inject-at-line explained below.


To inject content at a specific line, use this format:

# File /path/to/file::inject-at-line:line-number
Content to be injected at line-number
# EndFile /path/to/file

For multiple operations in the same file, use separate file blocks for each operation:

# File /path/to/file::inject-at-line:line-numberX
Content to be injected at line-numberX
# EndFile /path/to/file

# File /path/to/file::inject-at-line:line-numberY
Content to be injected at line-numberY
# EndFile /path/to/file

To delete an ENTIRE file, use this format:

# File /path/to/file::delete-file
# EndFile /path/to/file
 

Address the issue directly in your code changes.


Keep explanations brief and within the code as comments if needed. 
Be concise with your answers, make sure you have a short plan before you write code.
