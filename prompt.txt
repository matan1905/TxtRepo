# Instructions for Editing Files

When making changes to files, use the following formats:

## Create or Replace Entire Files

To create a new file or completely replace an existing file's content:

```
# File /path/to/file
[Entire content of the file]
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

**CAUTION:** This will remove all existing content in the file. Use with care!

## Edit a Section

To make targeted changes to a specific part of a file:

```
# File /path/to/file::edit-section
[Optional - A few lines of unique context before the change]
---[Lines to be removed (include JUST enough context to be unique)]
+++[Lines to be added]
[Optional - A few lines of unique context after the change]
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

**Important rules for edit-section:**
- If the section is very repeating, Include just enough unique context before and after the change to precisely locate the section.
- Minimize the context to just what's necessary (usually 0-3 lines before / after).
- Lines starting with `---` will be removed.
- Lines starting with `+++` will be added.
- All lines (except for the '+++') are used for context and should match the existing file content exactly.
- If there are no meaningful lines before the content to be changed (e.g., only line breaks), it's advised to start directly with the `---` line.

**Good example:**
```
# File /path/to/file::edit-section
def add_bias(x):
---    bias = 1
+++    bias = 5
    return bias + x
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

**Good example (when editing at the start of a file or section):**
```
# File /path/to/file::edit-section
---# Old header
+++# Updated header
import math
import random
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

**Bad example (avoid this):**
```
# File /path/to/file::edit-section
import logging
import time
def unrelated_function():
    return "This function has nothing to do with anything"
def add_bias(x):
---    bias = 1
+++    bias = 5
    return bias + x
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

## Inject Content at a Specific Line

To add new content at a specific line number:

```
# File /path/to/file::inject-at-line:line-number
[Content to be injected]
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

## Delete an Entire File

To remove a file completely:

```
# File /path/to/file::delete-file
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

Remember to address the issue directly in your code changes and keep explanations brief. If needed, include short comments within the code.
