# Generic Instructions for Editing Files

When making changes to files, use the following formats:

## Create or Replace Entire Files

To create a new file or completely replace an existing file's content:

```
# File /path/to/file
[Entire content of the file]
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

**CAUTION:** This will remove all existing content in the file. Use with care!

## Edit a Section

To make targeted changes to a specific part of a file:

```
# File /path/to/file::edit-section
[Minimal unique context before the change]
---[Lines to be removed]
+++[Lines to be added]
[Minimal unique context after the change]
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

**Key principles for edit-section:**
1. Minimal Context: Include only enough context to uniquely identify the section to be changed.
2. Precise Changes: Only include the exact lines to be removed or added.
3. Exact Matching: All lines except those starting with '+++' must match the existing file content exactly.
4. Multiple Edits: Use separate edit-section blocks for different changes in the same file.
5. Start of File: When editing at the beginning of a file, you may start directly with the '---' line.

## Inject Content at a Specific Line

To add new content at a specific line number:

```
# File /path/to/file::inject-at-line:line-number
[Content to be injected]
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

## Delete an Entire File

To remove a file completely:

```
# File /path/to/file::delete-file
# EndFile /path/to/file
```

## General Guidelines

1. Make minimal, precise edits.
2. Use multiple edit blocks for different changes in the same file.
3. Avoid large, sweeping changes in a single edit when possible.
4. Include brief comments within the code if needed for clarity.
5. Always consider the context and purpose of the edit.

Remember, the goal is to make clear, targeted changes that are easy to understand and implement.
